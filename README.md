This project focuses on analyzing drug data, including ratings, side effects, and classifications. The script preprocesses the dataset, handles missing values, encodes categorical data, scales numerical features, and visualizes key insights.

Key Functionalities:

Loads and cleans drug side effects dataset.

Manages missing values for both categorical and numerical columns.

Applies Label Encoding for categorical features.

Scales numerical features using StandardScaler.

Removes duplicate records.

Extracts common side effects like Hives, Difficult Breathing, and Itching.

Produces insightful visualizations:

Distribution of drug ratings

Most prescribed drugs per condition

Drug ratings by class (boxplot)

Correlation heatmap

Frequency of specific side effects
